# LeetCode Problem 48 - Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.
Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:
You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 
2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
