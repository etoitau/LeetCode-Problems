# Code Sample
Provided for everlaw job application by [Kyle Chatman](http://www.kchatman.com)

## Introduction
Please note I have about 20 repositories shared publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/etoitau)
so if this isn't what you are looking for you can probably find it there. You can also find
descriptions, video demos, code, and links to live versions of some of my projects at 
[cs.kchatman.com](http://cs.kchatman.com)

I picked this sample because:
- It is concise and has a quickly understood problem to solve and solution
- I thought the numerical sequence central to the problem was amusing
- My solution uses some outside the box thinking to perform better than any other

## Description Of Approach
I noticed that the spec only required a solution to be able to provide one of the first 30
terms in the sequence. And while the sequence does grow something like exponentially, 
the 30th term is not prohibitively large. So I just submitted a method which had the first
30 terms hard-coded and returned whichever one was required.

That said, I did still have to write code to generate the first 30 terms, and went a bit 
farther to format it into code that I could paste into my solution method, so hopefully you 
agree that it's more cheeky than cheating.
